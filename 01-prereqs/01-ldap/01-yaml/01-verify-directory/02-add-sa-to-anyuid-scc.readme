Verify Directory requires elevated privileges in order to start, so you need to add it to the "anyuid" Security Context Constraint

Type this command:
   oc edit scc anyuid

Add the isvd service account to the list of users:

   users:
   - system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:verify

(Replace <namespace> with the namespace you are deploying in)

Note:

If users looks like this:
   users: []

delete the brackets and then add the line underneath users: as shown above
